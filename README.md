# ✦ blessy!! — Cosmic Portfolio

> _"A glowing world of code, stars, and quiet inspiration."_ 🌠  

This is my **personal portfolio site**, built to represent my vibe —  
dark cosmic tones, smooth motion, and clean architecture.  

Even though I’m a **Python developer** 🐍,  
this entire website was created **with the help of AI** 😅  
— from structure and animations to the final pixel of design.
